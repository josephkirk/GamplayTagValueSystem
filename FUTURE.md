- **Thread Safety**: Make the system fully thread-safe for environments where tag values might be accessed from different threads.

### Value Types and Containers
- **Dynamic Type System**: Extend the type system to allow for runtime registration of custom value types.
- **Container Types**: Support for array, set, and map container types as tag values.
- **Explicit Type Conversion**: Add explicit type conversion capabilities between compatible types (e.g., int → float, vector → transform).
- **Compressed Value Storage**: For large datasets, implement compressed storage to reduce memory footprint.

## Integration with UE Systems

- **Ability Cost Functions**: Use tag values to calculate dynamic costs for abilities.
- **Runtime Attribute Source**: Allow tag values to serve as attribute sources for gameplay attributes.

### Animation System
- **Animation Parameters**: Use tag values to drive animation parameters directly.
- **Blend Space Parameters**: Allow tag values to control blend space transitions.
- **State Machine Conditions**: Use tag values in animation state machine conditions.

### AI and Behavior Trees
- **Behavior Tree Decorators**: Create decorators that check tag values for decision making.
- **AI Perception Integration**: Use tag values to modify AI perception properties.
- **Utility AI Support**: Use tag values in utility-based AI decision making.

## Editor and Tools

### Debugging and Visualization
- **Runtime Value Inspector**: In-game HUD elements to display active tag values.
- **Tag Value Profiler**: Performance tools to track and analyze tag value access patterns.
- **History Tracking**: Record and visualize tag value changes over time.

- **Asynchronous Operations**: Support for non-blocking tag value operations.

## Serialization and Persistence

### Data Management
- **Versioning System**: Add version tracking for tag values to support data migration.
- **Diff/Merge Support**: Tools to compare and merge tag value data from different sources.
- **Partial Loading**: Support for loading only relevant subsets of tag values based on context.

### Platform Support
- **Cross-Platform Serialization**: Ensure consistent serialization across all supported platforms.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Special optimizations for mobile platforms with limited resources.
- **Server-Client Synchronization**: Improved tools for managing tag values in multiplayer environments.

## Extended Capabilities
